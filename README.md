To Do:
------ Top Priorities -------
1. Responsive design 
	-- Works fine fullscreen at 1920 x 1080 resolution, however for smaller screens it does not
	-- 'Bet' and 'Credits' uses javascript/jQuery to move around, it does not work as inteded if screen size is smaller then 1920 x 1080
	-- check responsive.css
2. Tooltip for bet amounts:
	-- Show tooltips when hovering over bet chips telling the user how much are they betting
3. Check browser compatibility:
	-- Mozilla works fine (for now)
-----------------------------


errors/bugs:

-- players.json and MySQL need to be updated at the same time, if not there is going to be a new entry in players.json;
